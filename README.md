 âœ” Who Am I?
 
  I am an in-house recruiter who believes a good cultural fit is just as, if not more important than skillset.
 
 âœ” What Do I Do?
   
   I find top-notch firmware engineers who like to take ownership in their work and make an impact. 
 
 âœ” Why Do I Do It?
       
Early in my career I expressed an interest in learning software development; but was told I should learn something more useful, like cooking.  
ðŸ’¥ Enter new passion - to encourage others to find a way to connect their passion to opportunities in the workplace. I've been working in HR & organizational development ever since.
I love recruiting because I get to focus solely on connecting the engineering talents and passions of others to our mission and purpose.
