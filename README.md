<h1>
  Who Am I?
</h1>
I am an in-house recruiter who believes a good cultural fit is equally if not more important than skillset.
<h1>
  What Do I Do?
</h1> 
I find top-notch firmware engineers who like to take ownership in their work and make an impact. 
<h1> 
Why Do I Do It?
</h1>       
Early in my career I expressed an interest in learning software development; but was told I should learn something more useful ... like cooking! ðŸ’¥   
Enter new passion to encourage others to find a way to connect their passion to opportunities in the workplace .... and I've been working in HR & organizational development ever since!
<br> </br>
I love recruiting because I get to focus solely on connecting the engineering talents and passions of others to our mission and purpose.

<h1>
What am I Doing Here Now?
</h1>
I'm looking for US based senior embedded firmware engineers with telematics experience.
